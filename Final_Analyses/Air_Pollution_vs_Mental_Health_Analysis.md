## Introduction

The subject of air poulltion and its impact on mental health disorders is one that has been given much attention in recent years. Many types of pollutants can have negative effects on health, but one of the most detrimental is particulate matter. There are two types of particulate matter:

PM10: Coarse particles, 10 microns or less in diameter that can irritate your eyes, nose, and throat. Dust from roads, farms, dry riverbeds, construction sites, and mines are types of PM10.

PM2.5: Fine particles, 2.5 microns or less in diameter, are more dangerous because they can get into the deep parts of your lungs â€” or even into your blood.

This report sought to analyze air pollution data and explore any possible correlation with the prevalence of depressive mental health disorders in countries around the world. 

## Methodology

This question of correlation was tested through a quantitative method of inquiry. The air quality data was gathered from the World Health Organization's Ambient Air Quality Database, compiling annual mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 for 600 settlements in over 100 countries. While some countries reported numbers as far back as 2000, most of the data collected was from the period between 2011 and 2019. The population and prevlanece of depressive disorders data was collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The GBD study utilized compiled data from 204 countries, territories and selected subnational locations.

The analysis was performed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Data sets collected were examined for normal distribution, and any outliers were eliminated. The final analysis was conducted with a series of 10 countries over a period of 10 years, from 2010-2019.

## Analysis Results

Data included the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2, measured in the micrograms (one-millionth of a gram) per cubic meter. The skewness of that data was as follows: PM2.5 = 1.23, PM10 = 0.91, and NO2 = 0.67. The data for prevalence of despressive mental disorders per country per year was measured as the number of cases reported in the location's population, and percent prevalence was calculated. The skewness was as follows: Number of Cases: 1.76, and Percent Prevalence: -0.34.

The countries with the highest concentration of air pollution were Mongolia, China and Bangladesh. The countries with the lowest concentration of air pollution were Estonia, Finland, and Iceland.

As PM2.5 is considered the most dangerous particle in terms of detrimental health effects, this element was focused on for the purposes of considering correlation between depressive disorders and air pollution. The scatter plot for the data indicated that the correlation coefficient between the elements of air pollution and depressive disorders was -0.26. This suggests that higher pollution levels may be linked to fewer reported cases, possibly due to underdiagnosis in more polluted areas. This finding tracks logically,
when considering what we know about the world: often, the highest polluted areas with the highest population
density have the least reliable and consistent access to a comprenhensive healthcare system.

## Limiatations

### Data Comparability

The WHO data was of a limited comparability between countries due to the omission of some data. This was cited as being due to "language issues or limited accessibility". This translated into a challenge in finding a time period where an adequate number of countries reported on all air pollutant metrics for a number of years.

### Sample/Socioeconomic Bias

In terms of the Global Burden of Disease study, the subnational locations with available data for query were largely very developed countries, indicating that there may be a sample bias. Also, the study did have sociodemographic index groupings, but did not provide detailed information about which country belonged to which index group. This made it impossible to acount for the socioeconomic element bias if one was present.
